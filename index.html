				<div class="about_content">
					<p class="about_para">
						Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr
						themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web
						development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of
						building software for an <b>advertising agency</b>, a <b>start-up</b>, a
						<b>student-led</b> design studio, and a <b>huge corporation</b>. <br /><br />
						My main focus these days is building products and leading projects
						for our clients at <b>Upstatement</b>. In my free time I've also released
						an <b>online video course</b> that covers everything you need to know to
						build a web app with the Spotify API. <br />
						<br />
						When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing, hanging out
						with my wife and two cats, or running around Hyrule searching for
						<b>Korok seeds</b>.
